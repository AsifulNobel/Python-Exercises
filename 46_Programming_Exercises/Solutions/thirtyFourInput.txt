In Greek mythology, Python was the earth-dragon of Delphi, always represented
in Greek sculpture and vase-paintings as a serpent. He presided at the Delphic
oracle, which existed in the cult center for his mother, Gaia, "Earth," Pytho
being the place name that was substituted for the earlier Krisa. Hellenes
considered the site to be the center of the earth, represented by a stone, the
omphalos or navel, which Python guarded.
Python became the chthonic enemy of the later Olympian deity Apollo, who slew
him and remade Python's former home and the oracle, the most famous in Classical
Greece, as his own. Changes such as these in ancient myths may reflect a profound
change in the religious concepts of Hellenic culture. Some were gradual over time
and others occurred abruptly following invasion.

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
