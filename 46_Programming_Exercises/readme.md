This repository contains the solution directory of 46 python programming exercises. These exercises have been compiled by Torbjorn Lager. But the solutions here, are written by me and collected from other people.

The solutions of all programming exercises have not yet been written by me. That's why there are only 41 .py solutions. I will try to upload them in the future.

Disclaimer: These solutions have not been written with the view to substitute python tutorials. These should only be used by people who are looking for python exercises or simple code and are beginning to learn python.
